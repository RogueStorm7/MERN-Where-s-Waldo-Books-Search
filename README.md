## Summary ðŸ“– 
Iâ€™ll take a fully functioning [Google Books API Search]() engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the [MERN stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mern-stack/), with a [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) front end, MongoDB database, and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)/[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end. This data will be stored in a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database.

- When the users loads the search engine. They are taken to the Home Page where. A menu is presented, and they can choose with the options to search the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books) or see books saved in the MongoDB database.

- The Search page has an input component that returns the call from the Google Books API, the information. These __"results"__ are displayed to the user.
